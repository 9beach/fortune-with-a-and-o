# `fortune` with `-a` and `-o`

Restores the deprecated `-a` and `-o` options to the **Homebrew** `fortune`
command, enabling the display of all fortunes, including offensive ones.

## Installation

Before install, please visit [fortune-mod/Offensive](https://github.com/Distrotech/fortune-mod/blob/master/Offensive) and remember that "It is easy to overdose on insult."

```bash
git clone https://github.com/9beach/fortune-with-a-and-o.git
cd fortune-with-a-and
./install.sh
```

You can now use `fortune -a` or `fortune -o` to display all fortunes.
